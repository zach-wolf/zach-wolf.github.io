I'm a senior analyst in the Detroit Tigers baseball analytics department. I focus primarily on major league advance scouting through data. I excel at exploratory analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and report building.

A lot of the work that I do is proprietary and for the lack of a better term, secretive. So I wanted to make a public portfolio to showcase my data science skills.
